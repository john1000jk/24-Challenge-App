# twenty_four_game

A Flutter application for the well-known 24 Game. Most of the files are found in the lib folder, but I also used several dependencies and assets specificed in the pubspec.yaml file. This is my first project using Flutter and Dart, and I had a blast making it!

## How to Play

If you've never played this game before, it's pretty simple. You are given 4 numbers that you must manipulate through a series of operations to make the number 24. You must use each number exactly once and you're limited to the simple operations ( \+ , \- , \* , \\ ). For more detailed instructions, refer to the 'How to Play' section of the app.

## Screenshots/Demos
Most of the other apps for playing the 24 game are overly cluttered or missing key features such as providing solutions and instructions. I created this app with the goal of not only solving these problems but also creating a clean user-interface that is friendly and doesn't distract from the point of the game. Here are some pics of the end product:
