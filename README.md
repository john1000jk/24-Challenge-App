# twenty_four_game

A Flutter application for the well-known 24 Game where players combine 4 numbers through a series of operations to reach the number 24. Most of the files are found in the /lib folder but there are important assets and dependencies in the /test/pubspec.yaml file. This was my first project using Flutter and Dart, but I think it turned out alright. Enjoy!
